# Web Server

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites to running the DayTrading Web Server on its own (Local)

For the React web server to be functional on your local machine, the transaction server and the quote server must be running as well. Refer to the README in transaction_server and quote_server to set those up.

To test the web server UI without interaction with the transaction server, starting up transaction server and quote server is not necessary.

## Prerequisites to running the DayTrading Web Server on its own (VM)

For the React web server to be functional on the VM, the transaction server must be running as well. Refer to the README in transaction_server to set that up.

To test the web server UI without interaction with the transaction server, starting up transaction server is not necessary.

## Running Web Server

To run the web server from this directory, you can run:

### `npm start`


This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser and interact with the UI

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
