# Web Server

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the DayTrading Web Server on its own

For the React web server to be functional, the transaction server must be running as well. Refer to the README in transaction_server to set that up.
To test the web server UI without the transaction server, starting up transaction server is not necessary.

To run the web server from this directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser and interact with the UI

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
